# Manual Config
Unfortunately, I haven't yet automated (even tried) the configuration of the provisioned
services. For now, here's the list of things to do:

## Archiva
- Create user **root/admin** (I'm using admin/password123)
- Create user **publisher** (publisher/password123). Set it as global repository observer and manager.
